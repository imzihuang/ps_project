In addition to the classic dot-pixel graphics being upscaled to 1080p and additional 4k resolution support, this “remastered” port of METAL SLUG XX is fully functional with DUALSHOCK®4 game controllers, including vibration support to make the heated battle feel even more hectic, and fan-favorite voice samples played through the controller’s speaker during the release of POWs and other in-game events. METAL SLUG XX also offers two different types of scanlines for players who want a true nostalgia trip, as well as newly implemented Trophies for those who love a good challenge! In addition to the six characters found in the original release, “the silent soldier” Leona Heidern is now playable from the beginning for even more action!
